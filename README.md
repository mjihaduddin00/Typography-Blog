# Typography-Blog
This is my assignment submission where I was tasked to create a site that utilizes a variety of fonts, styles, and more all while informing end-client's of what typography is as well as the different fonts that exist. This site utilizes HTML and CSS.

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Typography-Blog/

Thanks!
